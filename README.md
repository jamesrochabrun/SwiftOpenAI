## Getting an API Key

⚠️ **Important**

To interact with OpenAI services, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to obtain one:

1. Visit [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).
2. Sign up for an [account](https://platform.openai.com/signup) or [log in](https://platform.openai.com/login) if you already have one.
3. Navigate to the [API key page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and follow the instructions to generate a new API key.

For more information, consult OpenAI's [official documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/).

⚠️  Please take precautions to keep your API key secure per [OpenAI's guidance](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication):

> Remember that your API key is a secret! Do not share it with others or expose
> it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be
> routed through your backend server where your API key can be securely
> loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

SwiftOpenAI has built-in support for AIProxy, which is a backend for AI apps, to satisfy this requirement.
To configure AIProxy, see the instructions [here](#aiproxy).


## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

1. Open your Swift project in Xcode.
2. Go to `File` ->  `Add Package Dependency`.
3. In the search bar, enter [this URL](https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI).
4. Choose the version you'd like to install (see the note below).
5. Click `Add Package`.

Note: Xcode has a quirk where it defaults an SPM package's upper limit to 2.0.0. This package is beyond that
limit, so you should not accept the defaults that Xcode proposes. Instead, enter the lower bound of the
[release version](https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI/releases) that you'd like to support, and then
tab out of the input box for Xcode to adjust the upper bound. Alternatively, you may select `branch` -> `main`
to stay on the bleeding edge.

## Compatibility

SwiftOpenAI supports various providers that are OpenAI-compatible, including but not limited to:

- [Azure OpenAI](#azure-openai)
- [Gemini](#gemini)
- [Ollama](#ollama)
- [Groq](#groq)
- [OpenRouter](#openRouter)
- [DeepSeek](#deepseek)
- [AIProxy](#aiproxy)

Check OpenAIServiceFactory for convenience initializers that you can use to provide custom URLs.

## Usage

To use SwiftOpenAI in your project, first import the package:

```swift
import SwiftOpenAI
```

Then, initialize the service using your OpenAI API key:

```swift
let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey)
```

You can optionally specify an organization name if needed.

```swift
let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
let oganizationID = "your_organixation_id"
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey, organizationID: oganizationID)
```

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsurlsessionconfiguration/1408259-timeoutintervalforrequest

For reasoning models, ensure that you extend the timeoutIntervalForRequest in the URL session configuration to a higher value. The default is 60 seconds, which may be insufficient, as requests to reasoning models can take longer to process and respond.

To configure it:

```swift
let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
let organizationID = "your_organization_id"
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.timeoutIntervalForRequest = 360 // e.g., 360 seconds or more.
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey, organizationID: organizationID, configuration: configuration)
```

That's all you need to begin accessing the full range of OpenAI endpoints.

### How to get the status code of network errors

You may want to build UI around the type of error that the API returns.
For example, a `429` means that your requests are being rate limited.
The `APIError` type has a case `responseUnsuccessful` with two associated values: a `description` and `statusCode`.
Here is a usage example using the chat completion API:

```swift
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey)
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text("hello world"))],
                                          model: .gpt4o)
do {
   let choices = try await service.startChat(parameters: parameters).choices
   // Work with choices
} catch APIError.responseUnsuccessful(let description, let statusCode) {
   print("Network error with status code: \(statusCode) and description: \(description)")
} catch {
   print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```


### Audio

### Audio Transcriptions
Parameters
```swift
public struct AudioTranscriptionParameters: Encodable {
   
   /// The name of the file asset is not documented in OpenAI's official documentation; however, it is essential for constructing the multipart request.
   let fileName: String

   let file: Data
   /// ID of the model to use. Only whisper-1 is currently available.
   let model: String
   /// The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in [ISO-639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) format will improve accuracy and latency.

   public var model: String
   /// Whether or not to store the output of this chat completion request for use in our [model distillation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/distillation) or [evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals) products.
   /// Defaults to false
   public var store: Bool?
   /// Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim. Defaults to 0
   /// [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)
   public var frequencyPenalty: Double?
   /// Controls how the model responds to function calls. none means the model does not call a function, and responds to the end-user. auto means the model can pick between an end-user or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via {"name": "my_function"} forces the model to call that function. none is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.
   @available(*, deprecated, message: "Deprecated in favor of tool_choice.")
   public var functionCall: FunctionCall?
   /// Controls which (if any) function is called by the model. none means the model will not call a function and instead generates a message. 
   /// auto means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a function. Specifying a particular function via `{"type: "function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}` forces the model to call that function.
   /// `none` is the default when no functions are present. auto is the default if functions are present.
   public var toolChoice: ToolChoice?
   /// A list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
   @available(*, deprecated, message: "Deprecated in favor of tools.")
   public var functions: [ChatFunction]?
   /// A list of tools the model may call. Currently, only functions are supported as a tool. Use this to provide a list of functions the model may generate JSON inputs for.
   public var tools: [Tool]?
   /// Whether to enable parallel function calling during tool use. Defaults to true.
   public var parallelToolCalls: Bool?
   /// Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
   /// Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token. Defaults to null.
   public var logitBias: [Int: Double]?
   /// Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message. This option is currently not available on the gpt-4-vision-preview model. Defaults to false.
   public var logprobs: Bool?
   /// An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs must be set to true if this parameter is used.
   public var topLogprobs: Int?
   /// The maximum number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) that can be generated in the chat completion. This value can be used to control [costs](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) for text generated via API.

   /// How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Defaults to 1.
   public var n: Int?
   /// Output types that you would like the model to generate for this request. Most models are capable of generating text, which is the default:
   /// ["text"]
   ///The gpt-4o-audio-preview model can also be used to [generate audio](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio). To request that this model generate both text and audio responses, you can use:
   /// ["text", "audio"]
   public var modalities: [String]?
   /// Parameters for audio output. Required when audio output is requested with modalities: ["audio"]. [Learn more.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/audio)
   public var audio: Audio?
   /// Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics. Defaults to 0
   /// [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/parameter-details)
   public var presencePenalty: Double?
   /// An object specifying the format that the model must output. Used to enable JSON mode.
   /// Setting to `{ type: "json_object" }` enables `JSON` mode, which guarantees the message the model generates is valid JSON.
   ///Important: when using `JSON` mode you must still instruct the model to produce `JSON` yourself via some conversation message, for example via your system message. If you don't do this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, which may take a lot of time and give the appearance of a "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partial (i.e. cut off) if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.
   public var responseFormat: ResponseFormat?
   /// Specifies the latency tier to use for processing the request. This parameter is relevant for customers subscribed to the scale tier service:
   /// If set to 'auto', the system will utilize scale tier credits until they are exhausted.
   /// If set to 'default', the request will be processed in the shared cluster.
   /// When this parameter is set, the response body will include the service_tier utilized.
   public var serviceTier: String?
   /// This feature is in `Beta`. If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return the same result.
   /// Determinism is not guaranteed, and you should refer to the `system_fingerprint` response parameter to monitor changes in the backend.
   public var seed: Int?
   /// Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. Defaults to null.
   public var stop: [String]?
   /// If set, partial message deltas will be sent, like in ChatGPT.

   var streamOptions: StreamOptions?
   /// What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
   /// We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both. Defaults to 1.
   public var temperature: Double?
   /// An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
   /// We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both. Defaults to 1

```
Usage
```swift
let prompt = "Tell me a joke"
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))], model: .gpt4o)
let chatCompletionObject = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

### Function Calling

Chat Completion also supports [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and [Parallel Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling/parallel-function-calling). `functions` has been deprecated in favor of `tools` check [OpenAI Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create) for more.

```swift
public struct ToolCall: Codable {

   public let index: Int
   /// The ID of the tool call.
   public let id: String?
   /// The type of the tool. Currently, only `function` is supported.
   public let type: String?
   /// The function that the model called.
   public let function: FunctionCall

   public init(
      index: Int,
      id: String,
      type: String = "function",
      function: FunctionCall)
   {
      self.index = index
      self.id = id
      self.type = type
      self.function = function
   }
}

public struct FunctionCall: Codable {

   /// The arguments to call the function with, as generated by the model in JSON format. Note that the model does not always generate valid JSON, and may hallucinate parameters not defined by your function schema. Validate the arguments in your code before calling your function.
   let arguments: String
   /// The name of the function to call.
   let name: String

   public init(
      arguments: String,
      name: String)
   {
      self.arguments = arguments
      self.name = name
   }
}
```

Usage
```swift
/// Define a `ToolCall`
var tool: ToolCall {
   .init(
      type: "function", // The type of the tool. Currently, only "function" is supported.
      function: .init(
         name: "create_image",
         description: "Call this function if the request asks to generate an image",
         parameters: .init(
            type: .object,
            properties: [
               "prompt": .init(type: .string, description: "The exact prompt passed in."),
               "count": .init(type: .integer, description: "The number of images requested")
            ],
            required: ["prompt", "count"])))
}

let prompt = "Show me an image of an unicorn eating ice cream"
let content: ChatCompletionParameters.Message.ContentType = .text(prompt)
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: content)], model: .gpt41106Preview, tools: [tool])
let chatCompletionObject = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

### Structured Outputs

#### Documentation:

- [Structured Outputs Guides](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/structured-outputs)
- [Examples](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/examples)
- [How to use](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/how-to-use)
- [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/supported-schemas)

Must knowns:

- [All fields must be required](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/all-fields-must-be-required) , To use Structured Outputs, all fields or function parameters must be specified as required.
- Although all fields must be required (and the model will return a value for each parameter), it is possible to emulate an optional parameter by using a union type with null.
- [Objects have limitations on nesting depth and size](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/objects-have-limitations-on-nesting-depth-and-size), A schema may have up to 100 object properties total, with up to 5 levels of nesting.

- [additionalProperties](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/additionalproperties-false-must-always-be-set-in-objects)): false must always be set in objects
additionalProperties controls whether it is allowable for an object to contain additional keys / values that were not defined in the JSON Schema.
Structured Outputs only supports generating specified keys / values, so we require developers to set additionalProperties: false to opt into Structured Outputs.
- [Key ordering](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/key-ordering), When using Structured Outputs, outputs will be produced in the same order as the ordering of keys in the schema.
- [Recursive schemas are supported](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/recursive-schemas-are-supported)

#### How to use Structured Outputs in SwiftOpenAI

1. Function calling: Structured Outputs via tools is available by setting strict: true within your function definition. This feature works with all models that support tools, including all models gpt-4-0613 and gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and later. When Structured Outputs are enabled, model outputs will match the supplied tool definition.

Using this schema:

```json
{
  "schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "steps": {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "explanation": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "output": {
              "type": "string"
            }
          },
          "required": ["explanation", "output"],
          "additionalProperties": false
        }
      },
      "final_answer": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["steps", "final_answer"],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

You can use the convenient `JSONSchema` object like this:

```swift
// 1: Define the Step schema object

let stepSchema = JSONSchema(
   type: .object,
   properties: [
      "explanation": JSONSchema(type: .string),
      "output": JSONSchema(
         type: .string)
   ],
   required: ["explanation", "output"],
   additionalProperties: false
)

// 2. Define the steps Array schema.

let stepsArraySchema = JSONSchema(type: .array, items: stepSchema)

// 3. Define the final Answer schema.

let finalAnswerSchema = JSONSchema(type: .string)

// 4. Define math reponse JSON schema.

let mathResponseSchema = JSONSchema(
      type: .object,
      properties: [
         "steps": stepsArraySchema,
         "final_answer": finalAnswerSchema
      ],
      required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
      additionalProperties: false
)

let tool = ChatCompletionParameters.Tool(
            function: .init(
               name: "math_response",
               strict: true,
               parameters: mathResponseSchema))
)

let prompt = "solve 8x + 31 = 2"
let systemMessage = ChatCompletionParameters.Message(role: .system, content: .text("You are a math tutor"))
let userMessage = ChatCompletionParameters.Message(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(
   messages: [systemMessage, userMessage],
   model: .gpt4o20240806,
   tools: [tool])

let chat = try await service.startChat(parameters: parameters)
```

2. A new option for the `response_format` parameter: developers can now supply a JSON Schema via `json_schema`, a new option for the response_format parameter. This is useful when the model is not calling a tool, but rather, responding to the user in a structured way. This feature works with our newest GPT-4o models: `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, released today, and `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18`. When a response_format is supplied with strict: true, model outputs will match the supplied schema.

Using the previous schema, this is how you can implement it as json schema using the convenient `JSONSchemaResponseFormat` object:

```swift
// 1: Define the Step schema object

let stepSchema = JSONSchema(
   type: .object,
   properties: [
      "explanation": JSONSchema(type: .string),
      "output": JSONSchema(
         type: .string)
   ],
   required: ["explanation", "output"],
   additionalProperties: false
)

// 2. Define the steps Array schema.

let stepsArraySchema = JSONSchema(type: .array, items: stepSchema)

// 3. Define the final Answer schema.

let finalAnswerSchema = JSONSchema(type: .string)

// 4. Define the response format JSON schema.

let responseFormatSchema = JSONSchemaResponseFormat(
   name: "math_response",
   strict: true,
   schema: JSONSchema(
      type: .object,
      properties: [
         "steps": stepsArraySchema,
         "final_answer": finalAnswerSchema
      ],
      required: ["steps", "final_answer"],
      additionalProperties: false
   )
)

let prompt = "solve 8x + 31 = 2"
let systemMessage = ChatCompletionParameters.Message(role: .system, content: .text("You are a math tutor"))
let userMessage = ChatCompletionParameters.Message(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(
   messages: [systemMessage, userMessage],
   model: .gpt4o20240806,
   responseFormat: .jsonSchema(responseFormatSchema))
```

SwiftOpenAI Structred outputs supports:

- [x] Tools Structured output.
- [x] Response format Structure output.
- [x] Recursive Schema.
- [x] Optional values Schema.
- [ ] Pydantic models.

We don't support Pydantic models, users need tos manually create Schemas using `JSONSchema` or `JSONSchemaResponseFormat` objects.

Pro tip 🔥 Use [iosAICodeAssistant GPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-qj7RuW7PY-iosai-code-assistant) to construct SwifOpenAI schemas. Just paste your JSON schema and ask the GPT to create SwiftOpenAI schemas for tools and response format.

### Vision

[Vision](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision) API is available for use; developers must access it through the chat completions API, specifically using the gpt-4-vision-preview model or gpt-4o model. Using any other model will not provide an image description

Usage
```swift
let imageURL = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
let prompt = "What is this?"
let messageContent: [ChatCompletionParameters.Message.ContentType.MessageContent] = [.text(prompt), .imageUrl(.init(url: imageURL)] // Users can add as many `.imageUrl` instances to the service.
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .contentArray(messageContent))], model: .gpt4o)
let chatCompletionObject = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

### Response

OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search, computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data using function calling.

For handling image sizes, we utilize the `Dalle` model. An enum with associated values has been defined to represent its size constraints accurately.

 [DALL·E](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/dall-e)
 
 DALL·E is a AI system that can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language. DALL·E 3 currently supports the ability, given a prompt, to create a new image with a specific size. DALL·E 2 also support the ability to edit an existing image, or create variations of a user provided image.
 
 DALL·E 3 is available through our Images API along with DALL·E 2. You can try DALL·E 3 through ChatGPT Plus.

You can stream events from the [Create Thread and Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createThreadAndRun), [Create Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun), and [Submit Tool Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/submitToolOutputs) endpoints by passing "stream": true. The response will be a Server-Sent events stream.

OpenAI Python tutorial(https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview?context=with-streaming))

### Message Delta Object

[MessageDeltaObject](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants-streaming/message-delta-object) Represents a message delta i.e. any changed fields on a message during streaming.

```swift
public struct MessageDeltaObject: Decodable {
   
   /// The identifier of the message, which can be referenced in API endpoints.
   public let id: String
   /// The object type, which is always thread.message.delta.
   public let object: String
   /// The delta containing the fields that have changed on the Message.
   public let delta: Delta
   
   public struct Delta: Decodable {
      
      /// The entity that produced the message. One of user or assistant.
      public let role: String
      /// The content of the message in array of text and/or images.
      public let content: [MessageContent]
   }
}
```

### Run Step Delta Object

Represents a [run step delta](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants-streaming/run-step-delta-object) i.e. any changed fields on a run step during streaming.

```swift
public struct RunStepDeltaObject: Decodable {
   
   /// The identifier of the run step, which can be referenced in API endpoints.
   public let id: String
   /// The object type, which is always thread.run.step.delta.
   public let object: String
   /// The delta containing the fields that have changed on the run step.
   public let delta: Delta
   
   public struct Delta: Decodable {
      
      /// The details of the run step.
      public let stepDetails: RunStepDetails
      
      private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
         case stepDetails = "step_details"
      }
   }
}
```

⚠️ To utilize the `createRunAndStreamMessage`, first create an assistant and initiate a thread.

Usage
[Create Run](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/createRun) with stream.

The `createRunAndStreamMessage` streams [events](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants-streaming/events), You can decide which one you need for your implementation. For example, this is how you can access message delta and run step delta objects

```swift
let assistantID = "asst_abc123"
let threadID = "thread_abc123"
let messageParameter = MessageParameter(role: .user, content: "Tell me the square root of 1235")
let message = try await service.createMessage(threadID: threadID, parameters: messageParameter)
let runParameters = RunParameter(assistantID: assistantID)
let stream = try await service.createRunAndStreamMessage(threadID: threadID, parameters: runParameters)

         for try await result in stream {
            switch result {
            case .threadMessageDelta(let messageDelta):
               let content = messageDelta.delta.content.first
               switch content {
               case .imageFile, nil:
                  break
               case .text(let textContent):
                  print(textContent.text.value) // this will print the streamed response for a message.
               }
               
            case .threadRunStepDelta(let runStepDelta):
               if let toolCall = runStepDelta.delta.stepDetails.toolCalls?.first?.toolCall {
                  switch toolCall {
                  case .codeInterpreterToolCall(let toolCall):
                     print(toolCall.input ?? "") // this will print the streamed response for code interpreter tool call.
                  case .fileSearchToolCall(let toolCall):
                     print("File search tool call")
                  case .functionToolCall(let toolCall):
                     print("Function tool call")
                  case nil:
                     break
                  }
               }
            }
         }
```

You can go to the [Examples folder](https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI/tree/main/Examples/SwiftOpenAIExample/SwiftOpenAIExample) in this package, navigate to the 'Configure Assistants' tab, create an assistant, and follow the subsequent steps.

⚠️ We currently support Only Assistants Beta 2. If you need support for Assistants V1, you can access it in the jroch-supported-branch-for-assistants-v1 branch or in the v2.3 release.. [Check OpenAI Documentation for details on migration.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/migration))

## Azure OpenAI

This library provides support for both chat completions and chat stream completions through Azure OpenAI. Currently, `DefaultOpenAIAzureService` supports chat completions, including both streamed and non-streamed options.

For more information about Azure configuration refer to the [documentation.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference)

To instantiate `DefaultOpenAIAzureService` you need to provide a `AzureOpenAIConfiguration`

```swift
let azureConfiguration = AzureOpenAIConfiguration(
                           resourceName: "YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME", 
                           openAIAPIKey: .apiKey("YOUR_OPENAI_APIKEY), 
                           apiVersion: "THE_API_VERSION")
                           
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(azureConfiguration: azureConfiguration)           
```

supported api version can be found on the azure [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#completions)

Current Supported versions

```2022-12-01```
```2023-03-15-preview```

### Usage on [Chat completions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions):

```swift
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(
                     messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))], 
                     model: .custom("DEPLOYMENT_NAME") /// The deployment name you chose when you deployed the model. e.g: "gpt-35-turbo-0613"
let completionObject = try await service.startChat(parameters: parameters)
```

## AIProxy

### What is it?

[AIProxy](https://www.aiproxy.pro) is a backend for iOS apps that proxies requests from your app to OpenAI.
Using a proxy keeps your OpenAI key secret, protecting you from unexpectedly high bills due to key theft.
Requests are only proxied if they pass your defined rate limits and Apple's [DeviceCheck](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck) verification.
We offer AIProxy support so you can safely distribute apps built with SwiftOpenAI.

### How does my SwiftOpenAI code change?

Proxy requests through AIProxy with two changes to your Xcode project:

1. Instead of initializing `service` with:

        let apiKey = "your_openai_api_key_here"
        let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey)

Use:

        let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(
            aiproxyPartialKey: "your_partial_key_goes_here",
            aiproxyServiceURL: "your_service_url_goes_here"
        )

The `aiproxyPartialKey` and `aiproxyServiceURL` values are provided to you on the [AIProxy developer dashboard](https://developer.aiproxy.pro)

2. Add an `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS' env variable to Xcode. This token is provided to you in the AIProxy
   developer dashboard, and is necessary for the iOS simulator to communicate with the AIProxy backend.
    - Type `cmd shift ,` to open up the "Edit Schemes" menu in Xcode
    - Select `Run` in the sidebar
    - Select `Arguments` from the top nav
    - Add to the "Environment Variables" section (not the "Arguments Passed on Launch" section) an env
      variable with name `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` and value that we provided you in the AIProxy dashboard


⚠️  The `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` is intended for the simulator only. Do not let it leak into
a distribution build of your app (including a TestFlight distribution). If you follow the steps above,
then the constant won't leak because env variables are not packaged into the app bundle.

#### What is the `AIPROXY_DEVICE_CHECK_BYPASS` constant?

AIProxy uses Apple's [DeviceCheck](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicecheck) to ensure
that requests received by the backend originated from your app on a legitimate Apple device.
However, the iOS simulator cannot produce DeviceCheck tokens. Rather than requiring you to
constantly build and run on device during development, AIProxy provides a way to skip the
DeviceCheck integrity check. The token is intended for use by developers only. If an attacker gets
the token, they can make requests to your AIProxy project without including a DeviceCheck token, and
thus remove one level of protection.

#### What is the `aiproxyPartialKey` constant?

This constant is safe to include in distributed version of your app. It is one part of an
encrypted representation of your real secret key. The other part resides on AIProxy's backend.
As your app makes requests to AIProxy, the two encrypted parts are paired, decrypted, and used
to fulfill the request to OpenAI.

#### How to setup my project on AIProxy?

Please see the [AIProxy integration guide](https://www.aiproxy.pro/docs/integration-guide.html)

## Ollama

Ollama now has built-in compatibility with the OpenAI [Chat Completions API](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md), making it possible to use more tooling and applications with Ollama locally.

<img width="783" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-24 at 11 52 35 PM" src="https://github.com/jamesrochabrun/SwiftOpenAI/assets/5378604/db2264cb-408c-471d-b65b-912795c082ed">

### ⚠️ Important

Remember that these models run locally, so you need to download them. If you want to use llama3, you can open the terminal and run the following command:

```python
ollama pull llama3
```

you can follow [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md) for more.

### How to use this models locally using SwiftOpenAI?

To use local models with an `OpenAIService` in your application, you need to provide a URL. 

```swift
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(baseURL: "http://localhost:11434")
```

Then you can use the completions API as follows:

```swift
let prompt = "Tell me a joke"
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))], model: .custom("llama3"))
let chatCompletionObject = service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

⚠️ Note: You can probably use the `OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey:overrideBaseURL:proxyPath)` for any OpenAI compatible service.

### Resources:

[Ollama OpenAI compatibility docs.](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/openai.md)
[Ollama OpenAI compatibility blog post.](https://ollama.com/blog/openai-compatibility)

### Notes

You can also use this service constructor to provide any URL or apiKey if you need.

```swift
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", baseURL: "http://localhost:11434")
```

## Groq

<img width="792" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-11 at 11 49 04 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7afb36a2-b2d8-4f89-9592-f4cece20d469">

Groq API is mostly compatible with OpenAI's client libraries like `SwiftOpenAI` to use Groq using this library you just need to create an instance of `OpenAIService` like this:

```swift
let apiKey = "your_api_key"
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey, overrideBaseURL: "https://api.groq.com/", proxyPath: "openai")

```

For Supported API's using Groq visit its [documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs/openai).

## OpenRouter

<img width="734" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d658d07-0b41-4b5f-a094-ec7856f6fe98" />

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quick-start) provides an OpenAI-compatible completion API to 314 models & providers that you can call directly, or using the OpenAI SDK. Additionally, some third-party SDKs are available.

```swift

// Creating the service

let apiKey = "your_api_key"
let servcie = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(apiKey: apiKey, 
   overrideBaseURL: "https://openrouter.ai", 
   proxyPath: "api",
   extraHeaders: [
      "HTTP-Referer": "<YOUR_SITE_URL>", // Optional. Site URL for rankings on openrouter.ai.
         "X-Title": "<YOUR_SITE_NAME>"  // Optional. Site title for rankings on openrouter.ai.
   ])

// Making a request

let prompt = "What is the Manhattan project?"
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))], model: .custom("deepseek/deepseek-r1:free"))
let stream = service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```

For more inofrmation about the `OpenRouter` api visit its [documentation](https://openrouter.ai/docs/quick-start).

## DeepSeek

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7733f011-691a-4de7-b715-c090e3647304)

The [DeepSeek](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/) API uses an API format compatible with OpenAI. By modifying the configuration, you can use SwiftOpenAI to access the DeepSeek API.

Creating the service

```swift

let apiKey = "your_api_key"
let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(
   apiKey: apiKey,
   overrideBaseURL: "https://api.deepseek.com")
```

Non-Streaming Example

```swift
let prompt = "What is the Manhattan project?"
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(
    messages: [.init(role: .user, content: .text(prompt))],
    model: .custom("deepseek-reasoner")
)

do {
    let result = try await service.chat(parameters: parameters)
    
    // Access the response content
    if let content = result.choices.first?.message.content {
        print("Response: \(content)")
    }
    
    // Access reasoning content if available
    if let reasoning = result.choices.first?.message.reasoningContent {
        print("Reasoning: \(reasoning)")
    }
} catch {
    print("Error: \(error)")
}
```

Streaming Example

```swift

Notes

- The DeepSeek API is compatible with OpenAI's format but uses different model names
- Use .custom("deepseek-reasoner") to specify the DeepSeek model
- The `reasoningContent` field is optional and specific to DeepSeek's API
- Error handling follows the same pattern as standard OpenAI requests.

For more inofrmation about the `DeepSeek` api visit its [documentation](https://api-docs.deepseek.com).

Gemini is now accessible through the OpenAI Library. See the announcement [here](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-is-now-accessible-from-the-openai-library/).
SwiftOpenAI supports all OpenAI endpoints. However, please refer to the [Gemini documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai) to understand which APIs are currently compatible."


You can instantiate a `OpenAIService` using your Gemini token like this...

```swift
let geminiAPIKey = "your_api_key"
let baseURL = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com"
let version = "v1beta"

let service = OpenAIServiceFactory.service(
   apiKey: apiKey, 
   overrideBaseURL: baseURL, 
   overrideVersion: version)
```

You can now create a chat request using the .custom model parameter and pass the model name as a string.

```swift
let parameters = ChatCompletionParameters(
      messages: [.init(
      role: .user,
      content: content)],
      model: .custom("gemini-1.5-flash"))

let stream = try await service.startStreamedChat(parameters: parameters)
```
